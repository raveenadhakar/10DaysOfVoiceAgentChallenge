- [x] 1.Implement the task for – Voice Improv Battle





Today you will build a voice-first improv game show:

Game Concept: “Improv Battle”
This is not a quiz or trivia game. It is a short-form improv performance game.

Each round (single-player):

Host sets up an improv scenario
(e.g., “You are a barista who has to tell a customer that their latte is actually a portal to another dimension.”)
You (the player) act it out for a bit.
The host reacts:
Comments on what you did.
Might tease, critique, or praise.
Moves to the next scenario.
In multi-player (optional advanced goal):

Host sets the scene.
Player 1 starts the improv.
Player 2 must continue the story from Player 1’s last line.
Host reacts to how well the handoff and continuation worked.
Primary Goal (Required) – Single-Player Improv Battle
Build a single-player improv host where:

The user joins from the browser.
The AI plays the role of a game show host.
The game runs through several improv scenarios.
The host reacts in a varied, realistic way.
Behaviour Requirements
Your system should:

Let a single user join a game room from the web UI

Simple join screen:
Text field for “Name” (contestant name).
Button: “Start Improv Battle”.
On click:
Connect to a LiveKit voice agent.
Start the improv with AI host.
Use a strong “improv host” persona

In your system prompt, define:

Role: “You are the host of a TV improv show called ‘Improv Battle’.”

Style:

High-energy, witty, and clear about rules.

Reactions should be realistic:

Sometimes amused, sometimes unimpressed, sometimes pleasantly surprised.
Not always supportive; light teasing and honest critique are allowed.
Stay respectful and non-abusive.
Structure:

Introduce the show and explain the basic rules.

Run N improv rounds (e.g., 3–5).

For each round:

Set a scenario.
Ask the player to improvise.
Once they finish, react and move on.
Maintain basic game state in backend

Use a simple state object per session, for example:

improv_state = {
    "player_name": None,
    "current_round": 0,
    "max_rounds": 3,
    "rounds": [],  # each: {"scenario": str, "host_reaction": str}
    "phase": "intro",  # "intro" | "awaiting_improv" | "reacting" | "done"
}
The backend should:

Set player_name from the first answer if not provided explicitly.
Increment current_round as each scenario completes.
Move phase between awaiting_improv and reacting.
Generate improv scenarios and listen for player performance

Prepare a list of scenarios (JSON) or generate them via LLM.

Each scenario should be:

Clear: who the player is, what’s happening, what the tension is.
A prompt that encourages playing a character or situation.
Examples of scenarios:

“You are a time-travelling tour guide explaining modern smartphones to someone from the 1800s.”
“You are a restaurant waiter who must calmly tell a customer that their order has escaped the kitchen.”
“You are a customer trying to return an obviously cursed object to a very skeptical shop owner.”
Flow per round:

Host: announces the scenario and clearly tells the player to start improvising.
Player: responds in character.
When the player stops, or indicates they are done (e.g., pauses and says “Okay” or “End scene”), the host reacts.
You can use simple heuristics for “end of scene”, such as:

A specific phrase (“End scene”) or
A maximum time / number of user turns.
Host reactions that feel varied and realistic

After each scene:

Host should:

Comment on what worked, what was weird, or what was flat.

Mix positive and critical feedback:

Sometimes: “That was hilarious, especially the part where…”
Sometimes: “That felt a bit rushed; you could have leaned more into the character.”
To encourage this:

Add to the prompt that the host should randomly choose between more supportive, neutral, or mildly critical tones, while staying constructive and safe.
Store the reaction text in improv_state["rounds"].

Provide a short closing summary

When current_round reaches max_rounds:

Host should:

Summarize what kind of improviser the player seemed to be:

Emphasis, for example, on character, absurdity, emotional range, etc.
Mention specific moments or scenes that stood out.

Thank the player and close the show.

Handle early exit

If the user clearly indicates they want to stop (e.g., “stop game”, “end show”), the host should:

Confirm and gracefully end the session.
If you implement all of the above, your Day 10 primary goal is complete.
